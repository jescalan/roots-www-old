    Using javascript libraries on the client-side is super helpful, but downloading them for every project and keeping them up to date is a huge pain. Luckily, the wonderful developers at twitter created [bower](http://twitter.github.com/bower/) for this exact purpose. You can run `roots install` followed by any package name to have bower install it directly into the `js/components` folder of your roots project. Also available:

    `roots js list` - list of installed packages    
    `roots js search name` - search for a package by `name`    
    `roots js update name` - update `name` to the latest version    
    `roots js uninstall name` - remove `name`    
    `roots js info name` - get more info about `name`    

    There are a lot of great open-source packages registered with bower. Check them out [here](http://sindresorhus.com/bower-components/). In addition, [require.js](http://requirejs.org) is included by default in new project templates to help load your client-side javascript dependencies smoothly.
